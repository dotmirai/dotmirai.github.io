Hello.

Iâ€™m a 2nd-year college student, taking B.S. in Computer Science at Adamson University. Part-time Bug Bounty Hunter and Penetration Tester that focuses on web applications. I started participating in bug bounty platforms like Bugcrowd and Hackerone in early 2014. I was acknowledged on several websites such as Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Samsung, Blackberry, etc. I also play CTF and HackTheBox in my leisure time.
