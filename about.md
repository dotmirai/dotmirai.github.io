I'm 2nd year college student, taking B.S. in Computer Science in Adamson University. Part-time Bug Bounty Hunter and Penetration Tester that focuses on web applications. I started participating in bug bounty platforms like **Bugcrowd** and **Hackerone** on early 2014. Acknowledged on several websites such as Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Samsung, Blackberry, etc. I also play CTF on my leisure time.
