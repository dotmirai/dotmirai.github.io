Iâ€™m a 3rd year college B.S. in Computer Science student. A part-time Bug Bounty Hunter and Penetration Tester that focuses on web applications. I started participating in bug bounty platforms like Bugcrowd and Hackerone in early 2014. I was acknowledged on several websites such as Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Samsung, Blackberry, etc. I also play CTF and HackTheBox in my leisure time.
